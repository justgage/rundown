0.1.0
=====

A pairing of Rust and Elixir (through a Port, not a NIF) to allow websites to have Markdown-based comments sections.

Successfully converts GFM to HTML, passing it through Ammonia and Comrak. Also bundles pre-built binaries for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD.

This is going to need *a lot* of work, both in terms of software-development-lifecycle control and adding features to the thing (for example, we probably want to support more Markdown flavors than just GFM), but it's a usable MVP.
